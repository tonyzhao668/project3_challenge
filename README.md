    * The following tools deployed : Pandas, Matplotlib, 6 machine learning models, HTML, CSS, Tableau, Javascript etc.
    * Data has been thoroughly checked, all main statistics parameters calculated, all variables correlation matrix conducted, outliers calculated and recorded. However the outliers are found too many more than 1000 rows, so did not deleted before analysis.
    * Machine learning operation done and predictions made, with best R2 score 0.84 achieved.
    * 15 visualizations made for the data story telling.
